# JPEG Algorithm and Compression Techniques

## 1. Implementation of JPEG Algorithm
This section explains the implementation of the JPEG compression algorithm, including the key steps involved in compressing an image using the JPEG standard.

### 1.1 Analysis of JPEG Compression with and without Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
In this section, we compare the performance of JPEG compression both with and without the inclusion of Run-Length Encoding (RLE). We also discuss how RLE works in conjunction with the zig-zag traversal of the matrix.

### 1.2 Zig-Zag Traversal of the Matrix
This subsection describes the process of zig-zag traversal used in JPEG compression to efficiently encode the frequency components.

## 2. Edge-Based Image Compression with Homogeneous Diffusion
This section focuses on a novel edge-based image compression technique that uses homogeneous diffusion. The approach is based on detecting edges and applying a specific encoding method to efficiently compress images while preserving essential features.
